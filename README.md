# OCR, LLM & XAI for Automated Real Estate Brokerage Processes

I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the University of Hull with a supplementary PCert from HarvardX in Computer Science for AI. My work focuses on integrating Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Models (LLMs) with Explainable AI (XAI) to automate real estate brokerage processes on a local machine, ensuring compliance with state statutes and privacy standards and in a separate capacity, making real estate services the price that they should be (about 5x cheaper than they currently stand, at 2.5% of the sales price to list the home as the norm.

My thesis, **"Automating Estate Agency Processes through OCR, LLMs, and Explainable AI"**, explores how these technologies can streamline corporate workflows while aligning with established statutes and privacy guidelines (I have private repositories that will be made public when my results are pre-published on a site like ArXiv, the thesis and adjacent projects are more specific than the broad title shown).
