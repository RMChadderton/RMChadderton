# OCR, LLM & XAI for Automated Audit Processes

I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the University of Hull. My work focuses on integrating Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Models (LLMs) with Explainable AI (XAI) to automate audit processes, ensuring compliance with IFRS and ASC standards. 

My thesis, **"Automating Audit Processes through OCR, LLMs, and Explainable AI"**, explores how these technologies can streamline audit workflows while aligning with established financial reporting and auditing guidelines. IFRS and GAAP are accounting standards that have corresponding audit standards that take a lot of time and money to confirm adherence to.

## Technologies

- **Languages:** Python, R
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Tableau, RStudio, PyCharm
- **Hardware & Resources:** Running on a MacBook M4 Max with access to the Viper Computer at Hull
