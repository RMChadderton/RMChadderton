# OCR, LLM & XAI for Automated Audit & Real Estate Brokerage Processes

I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the University of Hull with a supplementary PCert from HarvardX in Computer Science for AI. My work focuses on integrating Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Models (LLMs) with Explainable AI (XAI) to automate audit processes on a local machine, ensuring compliance with IFRS and ASC standards and in a separate capacity, making real estate services cheaper.

My thesis, **"Automating Audit Processes through OCR, LLMs, and Explainable AI"**, explores how these technologies can streamline audit workflows while aligning with established financial reporting and auditing guidelines (I have private repositories that will be made public when my results are pre-published on a site like ArXiv, the thesis and adjacent projects are more specific than the broad title shown).
