# INTERESTED IN FINE-TUNED SMALL LANGUAGE MODELS, THEIR USE IN MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS, AND EXPLAINABLE AI (XAI/AdvAI)

I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the University of Hull with a supplementary course from HarvardX in Computer Science for AI. My interests are in integrating Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Explanable AI (XAI) to automate real estate brokerage processes on a local machine, ensuring compliance with state statutes and privacy standards and in a separate capacity, making real estate services the price that they should be (estimated 5x cheaper than they currently stand, at 2.5% of the sales price to list the home as the norm).

My planned thesis, **"Comparative Analysis of Human Vs. Large Language Models with Tools (LLMwT) Performance in Residential Brokerage Tasks"**, explores how these technologies can streamline corporate workflows while aligning with established statutes and privacy guidelines. I have private repositories that will be made public when my results are pre-published on a site like ArXiv, the thesis and adjacent projects are more specific than the broad title shown. I also have a US patent pending on 'Corroborating LLMs for Email Classification and Contract Review Tools'.
